In this tutorial, you will learn the fundamental concepts of the Web UI Test, such as recording a test, adding a verification point, abstracting data by using data pool, adding a loop, running a test and a compound test, and viewing test results.
In the Web UI Testing perspective, you record tests from web applications. It gives you a recording and natural language scripting environment to test browser applications that use HTML5 and JQuery. You can test on Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Safari browsers. a Web application includes many user scenarios. For example, on an e-commerce website many users only browse the products, some of the users sign in and add products to the cart, and a few of them purchase the products and sign out of the web site.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to record a test scenario on the web application and generate the test, modify the test script, run the test, and view results. You will use http://www.ibm.com/software as the application under test.
